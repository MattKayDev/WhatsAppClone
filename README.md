This project was created using React JS to make myself more comfortable with React

## Known Bugs:

Currently it's not loading as fast as it could do<br />
Freezes after you send a message<br />
After sending a message it <br />

### Plans:

Clean up the code which is why it has these bugs<br />
Look at using IONIC to make it into a mobile app<br />
Look into making the chat seperate for each of the users - more like whatsapp<br />
Add extra functionality like settings, attaching files, sending emoji etc<br />
